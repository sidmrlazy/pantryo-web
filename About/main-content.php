        <div class="about-mid">
            <p> <span>PantrYO</span> is a Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh based Grocery Delivery Start-Up that was birthed during the second Corona lockdown mayhem. While many brands like Swiggy, Zomato served as heroes and helped us by getting our groceries and daily food essentials delivered at our doorsteps, they however let go of this wondrous service in the second lockdown. What was so convenient about their service in the first lockdown was the fact that like cooked food, our groceries were also delivered quickly and from stores we knew. We are such a fan! </p>
            <p>The second wave of lockdown was manned by the likes of Big Bazaar, Grofers etc. We did get our groceries at our doorsteps, but we were given slots and limited or unlimited stocks/brands to choose from. We are utterly grateful for their service too. </p>
            <p><span>PantrYO</span> is a fan of all these heroes and is an effort to be a cumulative and inspired version of all of them packed into 1. We deliver Groceries, vegetables, fruits, meat, and dairy products to your doorsteps from your nearby Kinara stores: as quickly as possible. It is our effort to make the new normal more convenient, more safe and more prosperous for Lucknow. </p>
            <p>Our Apps are available on <span><a href="">Google Playstore.</a></span> </p>
